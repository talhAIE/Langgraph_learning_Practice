# LangChain vs LangGraph

This document highlights the differences between **LangChain** and **LangGraph** when building AI-powered applications.  
Both frameworks are useful for chaining LLMs, tools, and workflows, but they approach challenges differently.  

---

## Challenges & Comparisons

### 1. Control Flow Complexity
- **LangChain**: Uses sequential or branching chains. Complex flows can become harder to manage.  
- **LangGraph**: Provides a graph-based structure, making complex workflows more explicit and easier to reason about.  

### 2. Handling State
- **LangChain**: State is often managed manually (memory, callbacks).  
- **LangGraph**: Built-in state management across nodes, making persistence and retrieval more reliable.  

### 3. Event-Driven Execution
- **LangChain**: Execution is usually step-by-step and synchronous.  
- **LangGraph**: Supports event-driven execution, where nodes trigger based on events and conditions.  

### 4. Fault Tolerance
- **LangChain**: Limited retry and error-handling support; requires manual logic.  
- **LangGraph**: Built-in mechanisms for retries, recovery, and error isolation.  

### 5. Human in the Loop
- **LangChain**: Achieved through custom callbacks or tool calls.  
- **LangGraph**: Native support for pausing workflows and waiting for human input.  

### 6. Nested Workflows
- **LangChain**: Supports nested chains, but complexity grows quickly.  
- **LangGraph**: Naturally allows nesting and composition of sub-graphs.  

### 7. Observability
- **LangChain**: Basic logging and tracing with integrations (e.g., LangSmith).  
- **LangGraph**: Graph-level observability with better visualization of workflow progress.

## Summary

- **LangChain** is simpler and works well for linear or small workflows.  
- **LangGraph** is better suited for **complex, stateful, and event-driven applications**.  

ðŸ‘‰ Use **LangChain** if you want quick prototypes.  
ðŸ‘‰ Use **LangGraph** if you need robust, production-ready workflows with better control.
