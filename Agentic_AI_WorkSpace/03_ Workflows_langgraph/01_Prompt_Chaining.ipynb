    "# Prompt chaining\n",
    "Prompt chaining is a technique in natural language processing where multiple prompts are sequenced together to guide a model through a complex task or reasoning process. Instead of relying on a single prompt to achieve a desired outcome, prompt chaining breaks the task into smaller, manageable steps, with each step building on the previous one. This approach can improve accuracy, coherence, and control when working with large language models."

       "'**What is Python?**\\n\\nPython is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for various purposes such as web development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. It was created in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.\\n\\n**Key Features of Python:**\\n\\n1. **Easy to Learn**: Python has a simple syntax and is relatively easy to learn, making it a great language for beginners.\\n2. **High-Level Language**: Python is a high-level language, which means it abstracts many low-level details, allowing developers to focus on the logic of their program.\\n3. **Interpreted Language**: Python code is interpreted at runtime, rather than compiled beforehand, making it easier to write and test code.\\n4. **Object-Oriented**: Python supports object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.\\n5. **Extensive Libraries**: Python has a vast collection of libraries and frameworks that make it suitable for various tasks, such as web development, data analysis, and more.\\n6. **Cross-Platform**: Python can run on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.\\n\\n**Uses of Python:**\\n\\n1. **Web Development**: Python is used in web development frameworks like Django and Flask to build scalable and secure web applications.\\n2. **Data Analysis**: Python is widely used in data analysis and science with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.\\n3. **Artificial Intelligence**: Python is used in AI and machine learning with libraries like TensorFlow and scikit-learn.\\n4. **Automation**: Python is used to automate tasks and workflows, such as data entry, file management, and system administration.\\n5. **Education**: Python is a popular teaching language due to its simplicity and ease of use.\\n\\n**Example of Python Code:**\\n\\n```python\\n# Print \"Hello, World!\" to the console\\nprint(\"Hello, World!\")\\n```\\n\\n**Getting Started with Python:**\\n\\n1. Install Python on your computer.\\n2. Choose a text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to write and run your code.\\n3. Learn the basics of Python syntax and data types.\\n4. Practice writing Python code and experimenting with different libraries and frameworks.\\n\\nOverall, Python is a versatile and powerful language that is widely used in various fields, and its simplicity and ease of use make it a great language for beginners and experienced developers alike.'"

While his friends spent their days playing video games, Talha spent his evenings coding in his makeshift home lab, fueled by a burning desire to create something new and innovative.\\n\\nTalha\\'s love for programming began when his father, an engineer, brought home an old computer for him to play with. As he tinkered with the machine, he discovered a world of endless possibilities. He spent hours watching tutorials, reading blog posts, and experimenting with code. His father, noticing his son\\'s enthusiasm, encouraged him to pursue his passion.\\n\\nWith the help of his father, Talha set up a small programming lab in their backyard. He spent every spare moment learning new programming languages, from Python to Java. He built simple games, chatbots, and even a website for his school\\'s annual event. Word of his impressive skills spread quickly, and soon, he was in demand for various projects.\\n\\nOne day, a local tech startup approached Talha\\'s father with a proposal. They wanted Talha to work on a project to develop an AI-powered chatbot for their customer service platform. Talha\\'s father was hesitant at first, but the company\\'s CEO, a friend of the family, convinced him that Talha was ready for the challenge.\\n\\nWith the help of his father and a mentor from the startup, Talha worked tirelessly for weeks. He poured his heart and soul into the project, pouring over lines of code and testing every possible scenario. Finally, the day arrived when the chatbot was ready to launch.\\n\\nThe company was blown away by Talha\\'s creation. The chatbot was not only functional but also intuitive, able to understand and respond to complex queries. The startup\\'s CEO was so impressed that he offered Talha a full-time job as a junior developer, with a salary that was unprecedented for someone of his age.\\n\\nTalha\\'s parents were overjoyed, and his friends were amazed by his sudden rise to fame.

       " 'improve': '**The Rise of Talha, the Programming Whiz**\\n\\nIn a small, sun-kissed town in Pakistan, where the streets were lined with the sound of bustling markets and the aroma of freshly baked naan bread, there lived a young boy named Talha. At just 12 years old, Talha was already an anomaly among his peers. While his friends spent their days playing video games and exploring the outdoors, Talha spent his evenings huddled in his makeshift home lab, fueled by a burning desire to create something new and innovative.\\n\\nIt all began when Talha\\'s father, an engineer with a passion for technology, brought home an old computer for him to play with. As Talha tinkered with the machine, he discovered a world of endless possibilities. He spent hours watching tutorials, reading blog posts, and experimenting with code. His father, noticing his son\\'s enthusiasm, encouraged him to pursue his passion, often staying up late to help him troubleshoot code and offering words of wisdom.\\n\\nWith his father\\'s guidance, Talha set up a small programming lab in their backyard, a cozy space filled with the scent of freshly cut grass and the hum of computer fans. He spent every spare moment learning new programming languages, from Python to Java, pouring over textbooks and online resources. He built simple games, chatbots, and even a website for his school\\'s annual event, showcasing his skills to his classmates and teachers.\\n\\nWord of his impressive skills spread quickly, and soon, he was in demand for various projects. Local businesses and community organizations sought his expertise, and Talha\\'s portfolio grew as he took on each new challenge. His confidence soared, and he began to see himself as a true programmer, capable of creating something truly remarkable.\\n\\nOne day, a local tech startup approached Talha\\'s father with a proposal. They wanted Talha to work on a project to develop an AI-powered chatbot for their customer service platform. Talha\\'s father was hesitant at first, but the company\\'s CEO, a friend of the family, convinced him that Talha was ready for the challenge. The CEO, a seasoned industry veteran, saw something special in Talha and believed that he had the potential to make a real impact in the world of technology.\\n\\nWith the help of his father and a mentor from the startup, Talha worked tirelessly for weeks. He poured his heart and soul into the project, pouring over lines of code and testing every possible scenario. He faced setbacks and challenges along the way, but he never gave up, driven by his passion for programming and his desire to create something truly remarkable.\\n\\nFinally, the day arrived when the chatbot was ready to launch.

They saw in him a role model, someone who had achieved greatness through hard work and determination. And Talha, now a renowned programmer, continued to code, always pushing the boundaries of what was possible and inspiring a new generation of programmers to follow in his footsteps.\\n\\n**Epilogue:**\\n\\nTalha\\'s journey did not end there. He continued to work with the tech startup, helping to develop new products and services that transformed the way people lived and worked. He became a leader in his field, known for his innovative approach to programming and his ability to bring people together to solve complex problems.\\n\\nYears later, Talha was approached by a group of young students who were inspired by his story. They asked him to share his journey with them, to tell them about the challenges he faced and the lessons he learned along the way. Talha smiled, remembering the words of his father: \"The real power of programming lies not in the code, but in the imagination and creativity it unlocks.\"\\n\\nHe began to speak, his voice filled with passion and conviction. \"Programming is not just about writing code,\" he said. \"It\\'s about creating something new and innovative, something that can change the world. It\\'s about using technology to make a positive impact on the world.\"\\n\\nThe students listened, entranced, as Talha shared his story with them. They saw in him a true inspiration, someone who had achieved greatness through hard work and determination. And as they left, each of them felt a sense of purpose, a sense that they too could make a difference in the world through the power of programming.\\n\\nTalha\\'s story had come full circle, inspiring a new generation of programmers to pursue their passion and make a positive impact on the world. And as he looked out at the sea of young faces, he knew that his journey was far from over. He was ready for the next challenge, ready to use his skills and experience to make a difference in the world.',\n",

He became a respected leader in the programming community, known for his innovative approach and his ability to mentor and inspire others. His story had inspired countless young students to pursue their passion for programming, and he had become a role model for many.\\n\\nOne day, Talha received an email from a young girl named Ayesha. She was a high school student from a small town in Pakistan, and she had been inspired by Talha\\'s story. She was struggling to find her place in the world, unsure of what she wanted to do with her life. But when she read about Talha\\'s journey, she knew that she wanted to follow in his footsteps.\\n\\nTalha was touched by Ayesha\\'s email, and he immediately responded. He asked her to tell him more about herself and her interests, and he offered to mentor her over the next few months. Ayesha was overjoyed, and she eagerly accepted the offer.\\n\\nOver the next few months, Talha and Ayesha worked together, exploring the world of programming and developing a plan for her future. Talha shared his experiences with her, offering guidance and advice whenever she needed it. Ayesha, in turn, shared her own ideas and aspirations with Talha, and he encouraged her to pursue her dreams.\\n\\nAs the months went by, Ayesha\\'s skills and confidence grew. She began to see herself as a true programmer, capable of creating something truly remarkable. And when she graduated from high school, she knew exactly what she wanted to do with her life: she wanted to become a programmer, just like Talha.\\n\\nTalha was proud of Ayesha, and he knew that she had the potential to make a real impact in the world of technology. He continued to mentor her, guiding her through the ups and downs of her journey. And as she grew into a skilled programmer, he knew that he had created something truly special: a new generation of programmers, inspired by his story and motivated to make a difference in the world.\\n\\n**Final Chapter:**\\n\\nTalha\\'s legacy continued to grow, inspiring a new generation of programmers to pursue their passion and make a positive impact on the world.

He saw the same fire in their eyes that he had once seen in himself, the same desire to create something new and innovative. And he knew that his journey was far from over. He was ready to inspire a new generation of programmers, to motivate them to pursue their passion and make a difference in the world.\\n\\nWith a smile, Talha began to speak, his voice filled with passion and conviction. \"Programming is not just about writing code,\" he said. \"It\\'s about creating something new and innovative, something that can change the world.
